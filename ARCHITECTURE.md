# PwmngerTS Architecture

PwmngerTS is a zero-knowledge, cross-platform password manager. This document details our technical architecture, security design, and intended data flow.

## 🏗 Monorepo Structure

We use a monorepo approach powered by `pnpm` workspaces to share logic and UI components across platforms.

## 🔐 Security Model (Zero-Knowledge)

The core principle of PwmngerTS is that the server **never** sees your plaintext passwords or your master password.

### 1. Key Derivation (Argon2id)
When you enter your master password, it is processed locally using the **Argon2id** memory-hard key derivation function.
- **Salt:** A unique, random salt generated per user.
- **Output:** A 256-bit Master Key (MK).

### 2. Encryption (AES-256-GCM)
All vault data is encrypted on the client side using **AES-256-GCM** (Galois/Counter Mode).
- **Authenticated Encryption:** Provides both confidentiality and integrity.
- **Unique IVs:** A fresh Initialization Vector (IV) is generated for every encryption operation.

### 3. Data Flow
1. **Plaintext Entry** -> Encrypted with MK (Client) -> **Encrypted Blob**
2. **Encrypted Blob** -> Sent to API (HTTPS) -> **Stored in Database**
3. **Download** -> API sends Encrypted Blob -> **Decrypted with MK (Client)**

## ☁️ Secure Synchronization

We sync "Encrypted Blobs" to our backend. Even if our database were fully compromised, the attacker would only see opaque, encrypted data that is mathematically impossible to crack without the locally-derived Master Key.

## 🚀 Technological Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Vanilla CSS.
- **State:** Custom hooks with `LocalStorage` / `Chrome Storage` persistence.
- **Crypto:** Web Crypto API (Browser), `expo-standard-web-crypto` (Mobile).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
